Simple test
===========

This is a very simple assignment to test your basic problem solving and \
your usage of modern tools and technologies. This is designed to not take \
a lot of your time as this is not the main interview and as such shouldn't \
take more than 20 mins if you're really experienced.

## Instructions
IMPORTANT: I will not try to compile your code or get it to run, so you don't \
need to write a working code. Just show that you know what you're doing (which \
is why you need to commit at every stage)

1. Clone this repository locally, and then push to your own repository (DO NOT FORK DIRECTLY ON GITHUB!!!, DO NOT STAR!!!)
2. The test is written in TypeScript and has a comment that explains what the code does. It should be easy to understand even for non-TS developers to understand.

### JavaScript/TypeScript developers (commit after every step)
3. Find a serious bug in the code and fix it (leave a comment explaining what you did) - commit at this point
4. Convert all functions to use async/await instead of promises and functional approach instead of loop (TIP, loop must be non-blocking) - commit again
5. Write a simple test using your favourite testing framework/library to test the two functions - commit at this point
6. Write a very rudimentary Dockerfile to deploy this stupid application - commit!!!

### Java/PHP/Go/Language X developers (commit after every step)
3. Recreate the two functions in your favourite language (it doesn't have to compile, I won't attempt to compile it)
4. Write a simple text using your favourite testing framework - commit at this point
5. Write a simple Dockerfile to build and deploy the project - commit at this point

### Finally
Send me the link to your repository. If I feel comfortable referring you, \
I will let you know. If not, I will let you know (you can still apply directly)
